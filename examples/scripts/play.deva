# Playing Audio
# =================
# You can play audio using the "call" and "spawn" directives.
# Call and Spawn can both be used to play groups or patterns.
#
# Call Syntax:
# `call <group_name | pattern_name>`
# 
# Spawn Syntax:
# `spawn <group_name | pattern_name>`

# This will play the instructions **sequentially** (one after another)
call myAwesomeGroup

# This will play the instructions **concurrently** (in parallel)
spawn myAwesomeGroup
