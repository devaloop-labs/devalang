 * Devalang CLI entry point

 * This is a placeholder that forwards to the Rust CLI binary.
 * The actual CLI is built with Cargo and should be run with:
 *
 *   cargo run --features cli -- [args]
 *
 * For the npm package, users should install the Rust toolchain
 * or we should provide pre-built binaries.
