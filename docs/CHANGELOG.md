# Changelog

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.13 (2025-07-24)

### ðŸ§© Language Features

- Added support for `fn` directive to define functions in Devalang.
  - Example: `fn myFunction(param1, param2):`
- Possibility to use triggers inside `let` statements, allowing for more dynamic sound manipulation.
  - Example: `let myTrigger = .myTrigger auto { reverb: 0.5, pitch: 1.2 }`

### ðŸ§  Core Engine

- Patched `trigger`, `call`, and `spawn`, `renderer` to handle correct cursor time in the audio interpreter.
- Refactored audio engine and interpreter to handle correct timing and execution while using `loop`, `call`, and `spawn` statements.
- Refactored `trigger` effects to apply more effects to triggers.
  - Example: `.myTrigger auto { reverb: 0.25, pitch: 0.75, gain: 0.8 }`
- Refactored `preprocessor` to handle correct namespaced banks of sounds and triggers.

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.12 (2025-07-21)

### ðŸ§© Language Features

- Implemented `trigger` effects to apply effects to triggers, allowing for more dynamic sound manipulation.
  - Example: `.myTrigger auto { reverb: 1.0, pitch: 1.5, gain: 0.8 }`

### ðŸ§  Core Engine

- Moved `utils::installer` to `installer::utils` to better organize the project structure.
- Set CLI dependencies as optional in `Cargo.toml` to allow for a cleaner build without CLI features.
- Patched `@load` relative path resolution to ensure correct loading of external resources.
- Patched `trigger` statement that was not correctly parsed when using namespaced banks of sounds.

### ðŸ§© Web Assembly

- Patched `lib.rs` dependencies to ensure compatibility with the latest Rust and WASM standards.

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.11 (2025-07-20)

### ðŸ“– Documentation

- Removed old documentation, please refer to the [new documentation website](https://docs.devalang.com) for the latest information.

### âœ¨ Syntax

- Added namespaced banks of sounds, allowing for better organization and management of sound banks.
  - Example: `.808.myTrigger` to access a specific trigger in the `808` bank.
- Added support for beat durations in `triggers` statements, allowing for more precise timing control.
  - Example: `.myTrigger 1/4 { ... }` to trigger the sound every quarter beat.
- Added support for beat durations in `arrow_calls` statements, allowing for more precise timing control.
  - Example: `mySynth -> note(C4, { duration: 1/8 })` to play a note for an eighth beat.

### ðŸ§  Core Engine

- Implemented `bank` resolver to resolve banks of sounds in the code.
  - Example: `bank 808` will resolve to a bank of sounds named `808` if exists (check bank available command).

### ðŸ§° Commands

> Use the `bank 808` statement to access the default sounds and triggers !
> Then you can use `808.myTrigger` to access a specific trigger in the `808` bank.

- Added `bank` command to manage banks of sounds.

  - `bank list` to list installed banks of sounds.
  - `bank available` to list available banks of sounds for installation.

  - `bank remove <bank_name>` to remove a bank.
  - `bank update` to update all banks of sounds.
  - `bank update <bank_name>` to update a specific bank.

- Added `install` command to install banks of sounds.
  - `install bank <bank_name>` to install a specific bank of sounds.

### ðŸ§ª Experimental

- Introduced lazy loading and namespace-based resolution of installed sound banks.

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.10 (2025-07-19)

- âœ… **Major refactor** of the resolution layer:

  - `condition`, `loop`, `group`, `trigger`, `call`, `spawn`, and `driver` were fully rewritten
  - Ensures **correct variable scoping**, **cross-module references**, and **imported symbol resolution**

- âœ… Audio interpreter updated:
