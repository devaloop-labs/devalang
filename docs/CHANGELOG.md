# Changelog

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.8 (2025-07-12)

### Syntax

- Implemented `if` directive to conditionally execute blocks of code.
- Implemented `else` directive to provide an alternative block of code when the `if` condition is not met.
- Implemented `else if` directive to provide additional conditions for the `if` directive.

### Core Components

- Implemented evaluator for audio statements, to execute conditional statements.
- Fixed `group` resolution and export issues.
- Implemented `Global Store` debugger to inspect variables by module for build command.
- Organized `TokenKind` and `StatementKind` enums for better clarity and maintainability.
- Refactored audio interpreter to handle the new syntax and directives.
- Refactored lexer to handle new directives and improve tokenization.
- Refactored parser to handle new directives and improve parsing logic.
- Added support for `call` and `spawn` execution of imported groups.
- Enforced scoped resolution of groups in `spawn` and `call` (must be imported in current module).

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.7 (2025-07-11)

## Examples

- Added examples in `examples` folder (group, loop, variables, index).

## Structure

- Moved `rust/audio` folder to `rust/core/audio` to better organize the project structure.

### Core Components

- Implemented `group` directive to define groups of sounds.
- Implemented `call` directive to call a group of sounds.
- Implemented `spawn` directive to spawn a group of sounds in parallel.
- Implemented `sleep` directive to pause execution for a specified duration.
- Patched line and column tracking in the lexer to ensure correct indentation handling.
- Patched string lexing advancing to handle first character correctly.

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.5 (2025-07-05)

### Syntax

- Fixed block parsing issues caused by missing or incorrect `Indent` / `Dedent` token detection.
- Indentation handling now triggers correctly at each newline.
- Improved reliability of nested blocks (e.g., inside `loop`) with consistent `Dedent` termination.

### Core Components

- Added full **WebAssembly (WASM)** support â€” Devalang can now be compiled for browser or Node.js environments.
- Prepared the ground for future IDE integrations (e.g., VSCode extension) by stabilizing core syntax parsing.

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.4 (2025-07-03)

### Audio Engine

- Integrated Audio Engine to handle audio playback and rendering.
- Implemented Audio Player to play audio files.
- Added support for audio playback with the `play` command.

### Commands

- Implemented `play` command to play Devalang files.

  - Added `--watch` option to watch for changes in files and automatically rebuild and play them. (once)
  - Added `--repeat` option to repeat the playback of the audio file. (infinite)

  Note : You cannot use `--watch` and `--repeat` options together. Use `--repeat` instead.

## Version 0.0.1-alpha.3 (2025-07-01)

- /!\ Major refactor of the project structure and module system /!\
- Refactored module system to support multiple modules and submodules.
- Patched all directives to be compatible with the new project structure.

### Commands

- Implemented `init` command to initialize a new Devalang project.
- Implemented `template` command to manage templates.
