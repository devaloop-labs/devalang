# Changelog

All notable changes to Devalang will be documented in this file.

## Version 0.1.6 - 2025-10-31

### üöÄ What's New

- Re-implemented auto binary download for NPM users in the postinstall script.
- Implemented for `loop` statement the support of `pass(<duration_ms>)` mode to run loop in background for a specified optional duration in ms (e.g. `loop pass(5000):`).
- Implemented for `for` and `loop` statements the support of `break` keyword inside their body to exit the loop early.
- Implemented `function` definition to create reusable code blocks with parameters.
  - Syntax: `function <function_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...):`
  - Call syntax: `call <function_name>(<arg1_value>, <arg2_value>, ...)`
  - Return syntax: `return <value>`
- Implemented new common effects :
  - `dist({ amount: <float>, color: <float>, mix: <float> })`: applies distortion effect.
  - `bitcrush({ depth: <int>, sample_rate: <int>, mix: <float> })`: applies bitcrushing effect.
  - `lowpass(...)` or `lpf({ cutoff: <float>, resonance: <float> })` : applies low-pass filter effect.
  - `highpass(...)` or `hpf({ cutoff: <float>, resonance: <float> })` : applies high-pass filter effect.
  - `bandpass(...)` or `bpf({ cutoff: <float>, resonance: <float> })` : applies band-pass filter effect.
  - `tremolo({ rate: <float>, depth: <float>, sync: <bool> })`: applies tremolo effect.
  - `vibrato({ rate: <float>, depth: <float>, sync: <bool> })`: applies vibrato effect.
  - `monoizer({ enabled: <bool>, mix: <float> })`: set to mono (one channel) the audio signal.
  - `stereo({ width: <float> })`: applies stereo widening effect.
  - `freeze({ enabled: <bool>, fade: <float>, hold: <float> })`: applies a freeze effect to the audio.
  - ... full list in documentation.
- Implemented trigger-specific effects :
  - `reverse(<bool>)`: reverses the audio sample when set to true.
  - `speed(<float>)`: changes the playback speed of the audio sample.
  - `slice({ segments: <int>, mode: <"sequential" | "random">, crossfade: <float> })`: slices the audio sample into segments and plays them back in the specified mode.
  - `stretch({ factor: <float>, pitch: <int>, formant: <bool> })`: time-stretches the audio sample by the specified factor.
  
    > Note: the current `stretch` processor in this release implements a simple resampling-based time-stretch. The exposed `pitch` and `formant` parameters are accepted by the API but advanced pitch/formant-preserving algorithms (e.g. PSOLA or phase-vocoder) are not implemented in this version, they are reserved for future improvements.
  - `roll({ duration_ms: <int>, sync: <bool>, repeats: <int>, fade: <float> })`: applies a roll effect to the audio sample.
- Implemented synth-specific effects :
  - `adsr({ attack: <float>, decay: <float>, sustain: <float>, release: <float> })`: applies ADSR enveloppe for the synth
  - `type(<"bass" | "pad" | "pluck" | "lead">)`: defines the type of synth

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements

- Moved unit tests to dedicated files next to source files for better organization.
- Added more unit tests for new features and edge cases.
- Improved `loop` statement to support infinite loops when no number is provided (e.g. `loop:`).
- Improved `on` events to support `bar(<int>)`, `beat(<int>)` for more precise timing.
- Refactored example scripts to use new features and best practices.
- Added a demo track 'hello-sound' to showcase an entire track made with Devalang.
- Synths and triggers now supports chained params. See [effect examples](../examples/scripts/effect.deva) for more details.
- Triggers can now be stored in variables. (e.g. `let myTrigger = .myBank.kick -> velocity(100) -> duration(500)`).
- Properties of objects can now be **accessed** and **modified** using dot notation. (e.g. `mySynth.volume`, `myTrigger.reverse`).
- Array items can now be accessed using bracket with index. (e.g. `myArray[0]` to access the first item).
- Arrays are now stored as a map under form `{ index: 0, value: <statement> }` to allow easier access and modification of items.
- Properties and array items can be **combined** using dot and bracket notation. (e.g. `myObject.myArray[2].volume`).
- Added arithmetic operators support `i + 1`, `i++`, `i - 1`, `i--`, `i * 2`, `i / 2`, `i % 2` inside loops and functions.
- Improved `print` statement to support printing variables, expressions, and complex objects.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditions that were not evaluated correctly.
- Fixed issues with `for` loops that were not iterating as expected.
- Fixed issues with `print` statements not displaying correct outputs and not handling variables properly.
